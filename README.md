# Replicator
StarTrek Replicator (matterstream assembler system)
// Work in progress.

Principles: stream of particles hit midpoint in acoustic field, object grows outwards in all directions and circumpolar between Lagrangepoints, in midair without any physical supportmaterial.

Forces: Acoustic levitation, sonoluminescence, UV 405nm, airpressure, magnetostrictive reverberation 

Energy: Experimerntal tests required, Estimate 4.5kW to run system for heatshieldtile production for Starship or similar.

Appllication: Life, the universe and everything.

Acoustic holograms are employed to capture/hold/direct/move molecules in a chamber. 
Matterstream introduces atomized matter in a through lensesas used in atmospheric nanoscale analysis.

Matterstream energizing & atomization channels: Non-newtonian fluids are manipulated by RF (fluidity) and gauss (elasticity).
Because the speed of sound is greater in a solid than in a gas we can add energy indirectly with less applied momentary energydifference to allow greater control and smaller scales of force. 
The forces on the matterstream are impinged at the standing wave amplifications where colliding acoustic fields allows emergent phenomena (sonoluminescence and microcavitation).
By controlling both the acoustic holographic fields (time) and the density of non-Newtonian fluids (space) we dont need as much precision in the overall system, and enable numerous paths to 
near-instant creation of atom-level engineered physical objects precisely. 
Hopefully without needed pre-processed matter and not too much energy.
