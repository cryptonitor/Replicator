Better way to awsh&cure 3D-printer resin stuff

System concept: Photothermal-Vapor Cure Reactor (PCVR)

1.Pre-wash vapor soften: Gently warm alcohol vapor softens uncured resin without full immersion.
2. UV cure phase: 405nm LED activate once urface is softened and reflective scattering drops.
3. Vapor Sweep: Circulating vapor clears surface resin mid-cure (no sisible poolking)
4.Final Heat And Hard cure: Light heat + full UV solidified shell.

Components.
-Sealed chamber ()=heat adn UV-resistant, like stainless or coated aluminium. Test with HDPE upcycled from old windowwasherfluid cans.
      -PTC heater for controlled vaporoization (50-70 degrees Celcuius sweet dpot)
      -Fan vortex ducting. For vapoer generation.
      -Cool zone: ^with cioooper fins or TEC for vapor condensartion
      -Drain/collection tray (for recondensed aCOHOLOL
      -sebsors: Temp, humidity, VOC (optional but ideal))
      -Glass or PTFE rtating pedestal (optinonal for symemtry, vapor circulation better for economy)

Easier workflow, easier automation, modular, can use sany vaporized wash, safe biologically, lower firerisk, seqaled vaporloop, less waste.
