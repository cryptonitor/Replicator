Experiment with liquid UV resin 3D-printer:
-Test energydensity aggreated asymptotes as it relates to sonoluminescence
-Test hypothesis regarding engineering internal stress using microcavitation
    Procedural evolution of emergent structures instead of first-order manufacture. 
      Embedding internal stresses in ephemeral corestructure/supportframes. 
        Releasing internal stress causes "Prince-Ruperts-Drop"-effect (desired effect) to eliminate post-print efforts
            Reducing post-print heatcure by strategically fracturing structures with stress released inside portions, to meeet rgeater structural requirements. 
                Controlled fracturing/relase of weakpoints (due to uneven heat during print).... Then through selfhealing similar to nuclear saltcooled reactors


Eliminate platform entirely from Resin 3D-Printer:
-Printing the object from all directions is faster. Why platform?!
-Dendritic generation, surface area increase prioritization to allow printing/curing/adherence to as much of the object as possible simultaniously.
